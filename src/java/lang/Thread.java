/**
 * A Thread is a single sequential flow of control within a process. This simply means
 * that while executing within a program, each thread has a beginning, a sequence, a 
 * point of execution occurring at any time during runtime of the thread and of course, an ending. 
 * Thread objects are the basis for multi-threaded programming.  Multi-threaded programming
 * allows a single program to conduct concurrently running threads that perform different tasks.
 * <p>
 * To create a new thread of execution, declare a new class which is a
 * subclass of Thread and then override the run() method with code that you
 * want executed in this Thread.  An instance of the Thread subclass should be created next
 * with a call to the start() method following the instance.  The start() method will create the 
 * thread and execute the run() method. 
 * For example:<p>
 * <pre>
 *	class PrimeThread extends Thread {
 *	    public void run() {
 *		// compute primes...
 *	    }
 *	}
 * </pre>
 * To start this thread you need to do the following:
 * <pre>
 *	PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread();
 *	p.start();
 *	...
 * </pre>
 * Another way to create a thread is by using the Runnable interface.
 * This way any object that implements the Runnable interface can be
 * run in a thread. For example:
 * <pre>
 *	class Primes implements Runnable {
 *	    public void run() {
 *		// compute primes...
 *	    }
 *	}
 * </pre>
 * To start this thread you need to do the following:
 * <pre>
 *	Primes p = new Primes();
 *	new Thread(p).start();
 *	...
 * </pre>
 * The virtual machine runs until all Threads that are not daemon Threads
 * have died. A Thread dies when its run() method returns, or when the
 * stop() method is called.
 * <p>
 * When a new Thread is created, it inherits the priority and the
 * daemon flag from its parent (i.e.: the Thread that created it).
 * @see Runnable
 * @version 	1.50, 06 Mar 1996
